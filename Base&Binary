0. "Base" in "base-X number system" means that the number's exponents are used for the place values. For example, base-10 goes by 10^3, 10^2, 10^1, 10^0
base-2 goes by 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0

The base also determines what digits are used (ex:base-10 uses 0 to 9, base-2 uses 0 and 1)

1. Binary is a numerical system in base 2 and a useful tool in computer science - 1 indicates on/true and 0 indicates off/false.
It is the easiest for the computer to read/helps it perform actions faster because the two digits used, 0 and 1, each correspond to turnign something on and off.

2. We'll have a sum value and a bianry number n. Within a while loop, with the condition (n>0), we'll take the n%10 value and multiply it by 2^i, i initialized before the loop as 0. Within the loop, after updating the sum, we increment i by 1 and also divide n by 10 to take out the rightmost digit.
