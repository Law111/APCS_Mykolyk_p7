Prework 07 -- Arrays // Multiple values of same type in single variable, random, array traversal, enhanced for loop
2021-9-x

I've been exposed to a good amount of arrays, so this wasn't too difficult to understand.
I feel like the enhanced for loop is more confusing, so I want to stay away from using that.
However, I couldn't do the exercises and kept getting errors, and I didn't know why.
